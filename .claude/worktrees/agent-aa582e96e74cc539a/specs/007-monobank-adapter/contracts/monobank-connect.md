## GET /api/v1/accounts (existing, extended)

No contract change. The response now includes accounts with `"provider": "monobank"` in addition to `"provider": "plaid"`. Existing consumers that ignore unknown fields are unaffected.

**Response shape addition** (per account object):

```json
{
  "provider": "plaid" | "monobank"
}
```

---

## DELETE /api/v1/accounts/{accountId} (existing, extended)

No contract change. When deleting a Monobank account, the system:
1. Soft-deletes the `BankAccount` row.
2. If no other accounts reference the same `MonobankCredential`, the credential row is also deleted.

The response is unchanged (`204 No Content`).
