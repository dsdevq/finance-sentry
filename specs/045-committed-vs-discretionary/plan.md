# Plan: Committed vs Discretionary Spending Split (045)

## Architecture decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Where the split is computed | `MoneyFlowStatisticsService.GetMonthlyFlowAsync` | Issue #538 AC2 puts it in the monthly-flow reader; that is the only place where account currency, transfer exclusion and the month window are all already in scope |
| Cross-module read | New method on the existing `IActiveSubscriptionsReader` port (Core) | The port already exists and is already implemented in Subscriptions + registered in `SubscriptionsModule`; no new contract, no new adapter, no DI wiring |
| Port shape | `GetActiveCommitmentMerchantKeysAsync → IReadOnlySet<string>` | The matcher needs a set-membership test, nothing else. Returning `ActiveSubscriptionSummary` rows would drag amount/cadence/date fields the split never reads, and extending that record would ripple through Liquidity + ~10 test construction sites for no gain |
| Why a *new* method rather than reusing `GetActiveSubscriptionsAsync` | That method filters `Kind == Subscription`, dropping installments, and returns display names | Committed spend must consider every active `DetectedSubscription` regardless of kind, and must match on the *normalized* key. Widening the existing method would silently change Liquidity's cash-flow projection — out of scope |
| Match key | `MerchantNameNormalizer.NormalizeDetectionKey(merchantName, description)` on both sides | The stored `DetectedSubscription.MerchantNameNormalized` is produced by exactly this function during detection. Any other normalization would systematically under-match |
| Where the key function lives | Moved from `SubscriptionDetectionJob.NormalizeForDetection(TxRow)` into `MerchantNameNormalizer` | Two callers now need it; the job keeps a one-line `TxRow` overload delegating to it. Satisfies AC3's "reuse `MerchantNameNormalizer`" and keeps one definition of the key |
| Currency | Committed native sum per (month, currency) bucket → `CurrencyConverter.ToUsd` at the same boundary as `OutflowUsd` | backend-rules.md Currency/Money rule: convert once at the reader boundary where account currency is in scope. Subscriptions span UAH/EUR/USD so a native cross-account sum is wrong by construction |
| Discretionary derivation | `DiscretionaryOutflowUsd = OutflowUsd − CommittedOutflowUsd` | Guarantees the partition invariant exactly (no rounding drift between two independent conversions of complementary subsets) |
| New `MonthlyFlow` fields | `CommittedOutflowUsd`, `DiscretionaryOutflowUsd` only — no native twins | AC2 names exactly these two. Native committed/discretionary amounts have no consumer; adding them would be dead surface |
| Reader is a required dependency | Plain ctor param, not the optional `?…= null` shape `DashboardQueryService` uses for its crypto/brokerage readers | Those modules can genuinely be absent from a composition; Subscriptions is registered in every one, so an optional reader would be a null branch that can never be taken. Cost is updating the 5 existing `MoneyFlowStatisticsTests` call sites |

## Story-slice surfaces

### [US1] Backend split — files touched / created

- `FinanceSentry.Core/Interfaces/IActiveSubscriptionsReader.cs` — add `GetActiveCommitmentMerchantKeysAsync`
- `FinanceSentry.Modules.Subscriptions/Application/Services/ActiveSubscriptionsReader.cs` — implement it (all active rows, both kinds, `MerchantNameNormalized`, ordinal set)
- `FinanceSentry.Modules.BankSync/Application/Services/MerchantNameNormalizer.cs` — gains `NormalizeDetectionKey(merchantName, description)` + the mobile-top-up regex moved in
- `FinanceSentry.Modules.BankSync/Infrastructure/Jobs/SubscriptionDetectionJob.cs` — `NormalizeForDetection(TxRow)` delegates to the normalizer
- `FinanceSentry.Modules.BankSync/Application/Services/MoneyFlowStatisticsService.cs` — 2 new `MonthlyFlow` fields, optional reader dependency, per-bucket committed sum + conversion, XML doc of the match rule
- `tests/FinanceSentry.Tests.Unit/BankSync/Application/MoneyFlowStatisticsTests.cs` — existing 5 call sites updated; new split tests incl. the cross-currency case

Constraint discovered while planning: `MonthlyFlow` is a positional record consumed by
`DashboardQueryService` → `DashboardController` → the Angular `MonthlyFlow` interface. Appending
fields is additive for JSON consumers, so the frontend model can stay untouched until US2.

## US1b architecture decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Where installment recognition lives | Moved out of `SubscriptionDetectionJob` (Infrastructure) into `Application/Services/InstallmentPlanRecognizer` | Two callers now need it, and an Application-layer service (`MoneyFlowStatisticsService`) may not reach into an Infrastructure job. Same move US1 made for `NormalizeDetectionKey`; no delegating wrappers left behind, the 5 test call sites were repointed |
| How a transaction picks its key | `CommitmentKeyResolver.Resolve(merchantName, description, amount, mcc)` routing to plan key or merchant key | The detector routes debits into two detectors *before* keying them; a matcher that keys everything as a merchant can never reach the installment half. The resolver is the mirror of that routing and says so in its XML doc |
| Guarding the mirror | A test that runs the real `DetectInstallments` and asserts every stored key is reproducible by `Resolve` | The two sides are only correct relative to each other. Asserting literal key strings would let both drift together; running the detector pins the actual invariant |
| Plan key needs the amount | `Resolve` takes `amount` + `mcc`, not just the name pair | Plan identity is (merchant, rounded amount) — the same shop can carry concurrent розстрочки. `Transaction` already carries both fields, so no new data has to be threaded in |
| Full early payoffs | Not plan-keyed; fall through to the merchant key and read as discretionary | The detector never stores a plan under a payoff's own amount, and the payoff marks the plan completed → not `active`. Matching it would require breaking the "only active counts" rule agreed in US1 |
| Rounding reuse | `PlanKey` rounds internally via `RoundPlanAmount`; the job passes its already-rounded group key through it | Rounding an integer is idempotent, so one method serves both call sites — no second `PlanKeyFromRounded` overload to keep in sync |

### [US1b] Installment matching — files touched / created

- `FinanceSentry.Modules.BankSync/Application/Services/InstallmentPlanRecognizer.cs` — **new**; markers, MCC, prefixes, `ExtractMerchant`, `RoundPlanAmount`, `PlanKey`, `PlanKeyForTransaction`
- `FinanceSentry.Modules.BankSync/Application/Services/CommitmentKeyResolver.cs` — **new**; the routing mirror
- `FinanceSentry.Modules.BankSync/Infrastructure/Jobs/SubscriptionDetectionJob.cs` — moved members deleted, call sites delegate
- `FinanceSentry.Modules.BankSync/Application/Services/MoneyFlowStatisticsService.cs` — matcher calls the resolver; match-rule XML doc rewritten
- `tests/…/Subscriptions/CommitmentKeyResolverTests.cs` — **new**; routing + the drift guard
- `tests/…/MoneyFlowStatisticsTests.cs` — `MakeTx` gains `mcc`; 4 new classification tests
- `tests/…/Subscriptions/SubscriptionDetectionAlgorithmTests.cs` — repointed to the recognizer
- `docs/money-semantics.md` §5a — match rule + known-limits rewritten

### [US2] Stacked chart — surface (NOT built; recorded for the next session)

- `frontend/src/app/modules/bank-sync/models/dashboard/dashboard.model.ts` — mirror the two fields
- `frontend/src/app/modules/bank-sync/store/dashboard/dashboard.computed.ts` — `incomeVsSpendingBars`
  gains a stacked committed/discretionary spending pair over `completeMonths()`
- `frontend/src/app/modules/bank-sync/pages/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts` — `[stacked]` binding
  on the spending `cmn-bar-chart` (precedent: the net-worth `cmn-area-chart` at line ~195)
- `dashboard.computed.spec.ts` + a Playwright spec (app-surface UI ⇒ browser gate applies)

**Do not start US2 until the coverage gate passes.** See spec.md [US2].
